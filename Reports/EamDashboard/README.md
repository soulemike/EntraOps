# EntraOps Dashboard

A **static web app** with the **Enterprise Access Model Dashboard**: the
static-web counterpart of the *EntraOps Privileged EAM - Overview* Azure
workbook, built entirely from your
[EntraOps](https://github.com/cloud-architekt/entraops) Privileged EAM export —
no Log Analytics workspace or Azure subscription required.

Part of **Privileged EAM Reporting** (see [`Reports/index.html`](../index.html)) and
styled after the Microsoft **Fluent UI / Azure Portal** design, matching the
[Classification Explorer](../ClassificationExplorer/README.md),
[Access Path Map](../AccessPathMap/README.md), the
[Tier Breach Analyzer](../TierBreachAnalyzer/README.md) and
[Privilege History](../PrivilegeHistory/README.md).

## What you can do

All views, filters and drill-downs of the Overview workbook are available:

- **Filters (workbook parameters)** – RBAC System, RBAC Tier Level, Service
  (dependent on the selected systems/tiers), Principal Type, Linked Identity
  (`AssociatedWorkAccount`), Privileged Type (Tenant Governance /
  Multi-Tenant Apps / B2B Collaboration / Local Identities, i.e. local users,
  groups and single-tenant applications) and a free-text search across
  principal display name, role name, scope name and role actions.
- **Sync source of privileged identities** – Cloud-Only vs. Hybrid tiles;
  click a tile to cross-filter every other view (the workbook's `SyncSource`
  export).
- **Restricted management of privileged identities** – donut chart of the
  Applied / Conflict / Not applied / Not available status derived from
  `RestrictedManagementByAadRole` / `...ByRAG` / `...ByRMAU` with the same case
  logic as the workbook grid; click a segment to filter the asset list.
- **Assignments of privileged roles** – donut chart of
  `RoleAssignmentType + PIMAssignmentType` combinations (Direct/Transitive ×
  Permanent/Eligible); click a segment to filter the asset list.
- **Classification of privileged identities** – tier tiles
  (Control Plane / Management Plane / Workload Plane / User Access /
  Unclassified) counting distinct non-group objects by
  `ObjectAdminTierLevelName`; click to cross-filter.
- **Classification of privileged access** – tier tiles counting distinct
  (object, classification-tier) pairs; click to cross-filter.
- **List of Privileged Assets** – grid with the workbook's threshold icons
  (principal type, tier level, restricted management), administrative units and
  restricted-management context blades, sync source, linked identity and the
  RBAC-system set per object. Click a row to drill down.
- **Related privileged role assignments** – aggregated assignment grid for the
  selected asset (or all assets) with RBAC-system icons, tier badges, scope,
  PIM assignment type, `EligibilityBy`, transitivity and service context.
  Select rows (checkboxes) to filter the classification grid below — the
  workbook's `SelectedRoleAssignmentIds` export.
- **Related role classification** – per-classification rows incl. `TaggedBy`,
  `TaggedByObjectDisplayNames` (expanded, `N/A` when empty) and
  `TaggedByRoleSystem`.
- **Detail blades (&#187; column)** – every row of the three grids ends with a
  &#187; icon (right of the review star) that opens a context blade (same
  sidebar as the services / restricted-management blades) with *all* details
  of the row: full principal properties (ids, UPN, privileged type,
  restricted-management flags,
  administrative units, linked identities, object & access classification) for
  assets; role/assignment/scope/transitivity properties, the assigned
  principals and every classification entry incl. matched role actions for
  role assignments; and scope ids, tagged-by object ids, matched role actions
  and holding principals for classification rows.
- **CSV export** for all three grids.
- **Review list / bookmarking** – star a privileged asset or role assignment directly
  from its grid row to add it to the same cross-tool **Review list** used by the
  Classification Explorer, Access Path Map and Tier Breach Analyzer (shared via
  `localStorage`). Every starred item and grid row keeps a deep link that jumps
  straight back to the same selection on reload.

## Computed columns

The dataset generator applies the same computed columns as the
`PrivilegedEAM` parsers (`Parsers/PrivilegedEAM_WatchLists`,
`Parsers/PrivilegedEAM_CustomTable`) and the Overview workbook:

- **`EligibilityBy`** – "PIM for Entra ID Roles and Groups",
  "PIM for Entra ID Roles", "PIM for Azure Roles", "PIM for Groups" or "N/A",
  derived from `RoleSystem`, `PIMAssignmentType` and `RoleAssignmentSubType`.
- **`RestrictedManagement`** – "Applied", "Conflict", "Not applied" or
  "Not available", derived from the object type/sub-type and the three
  `RestrictedManagementBy*` flags.
- **`SyncSource`** – "Cloud-Only" / "Hybrid" from `OnPremSynchronized`.

## Run it

The app is fully self-contained: it embeds its dataset as a script file, so it
works **offline from `file://`** — no web server, no internet connection, no
backend.

1. Export your Privileged EAM data with the EntraOps module
   (`Save-EntraOpsPrivilegedEAMJson`), producing
   `PrivilegedEAM/<RbacSystem>/<RbacSystem>.json`.
2. Generate the dataset:

   ```powershell
   Import-Module ./EntraOps -Force
   New-EntraOpsPrivilegedEamDashboardData
   ```

3. Open `index.html` in a browser (double-click works), or serve the folder
   with any static web server / Azure Static Web Apps.

> [!WARNING]
> The generated `data/` bundle contains your tenant's privileged inventory (UPNs, object IDs,
> role assignments, PIM state). Azure Static Web Apps — like most static hosts — serves every
> route **anonymously by default**. Do not publish this folder without putting authentication in
> front of it (e.g. `allowedRoles` in a `staticwebapp.config.json`, Entra ID authentication, or
> another access control).

To use a Privileged EAM export from another location, pass `-ImportPath`:

```powershell
New-EntraOpsPrivilegedEamDashboardData -ImportPath "C:\Exports\PrivilegedEAM"
```

Use `Remove-EntraOpsReportingData` to clear the generated (tenant-specific)
dataset again, or `New-EntraOpsReportingData` to refresh all reporting apps in
one call.

## UI regression checks

After changing dashboard CSS, table rendering, or the generated data contract,
regenerate the dataset and check the three grids at a desktop width with the
navigation expanded and at a mobile width. Dense grids intentionally preserve
their column widths; horizontal viewport scrolling is preferred to truncating
or overlapping operational data. Open a classified asset's information drawer
and confirm that each contributing assignment and its Control Plane reasoning
are visible.

See the separate [Privilege History](../PrivilegeHistory/README.md) app for historic
trends of privileged assets, role assignments and tier breaches over time,
built from the git history of your Privileged EAM export; its "Open in EAM
Dashboard Overview" button jumps back here with the same RBAC System / Tier
Level filters applied.

## Folder structure

```
EamDashboard/
├── index.html                    App shell (portal-style app bar + navigation)
├── css/styles.css                Fluent / Azure Portal design system + app styles
├── js/app.js                     Filters, tiles, donuts, grids, drill-down, CSV export
├── data/eam-dashboard-data.js    Generated dataset (window.ENTRAOPS_EAM_DATA)
└── assets/                       Logo
```

The folder is independent by design: copy `Reports/EamDashboard/` anywhere
(together with its generated `data/` bundle) and it keeps working. The
"Privileged EAM Reporting" navigation links to the landing page and the other
apps only resolve inside the full repository layout.
