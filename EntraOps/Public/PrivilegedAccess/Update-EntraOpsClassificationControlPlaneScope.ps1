.SYNOPSIS
    Update classification definition files for Microsoft Entra ID and/or Microsoft Intune (DeviceManagement) with fine-granular scope of Control Plane permissions based on privileged objects.

.DESCRIPTION
    Classification of Control Plane needs to consider the scope of sensitive permissions. For example, managing group membership of security groups should be managed as Control Plane by default.
    But this enforces to manage service-specific roles (e.g., Knowledge Administrator) as Control Plane. Protection of privileged objects by using Role-assignable groups (PRG), Entra ID Roles or Restricted Management Administrative Units (RMAU) allows to protect them by lower privileged roles with those permissions on directory-level.
    This function checks if privileged objects are protected by the previous mentoined methods and RMAUs with assigned privileged objects.
    A parameter file will be used to generate an updated classification definition file for Microsoft Entra ID and exclude directory roles without impact to privileged objects from Control Plane. All other assignments will be still managed as Control Plane.
    When DeviceManagement is included in ClassificationParameterScope, the function identifies privileged devices (owned by or associated with Control Plane and Management Plane users),
    resolves their transitive Entra ID group memberships, filters those groups to only include groups with Intune scope tag assignments, and replaces the group placeholders in the DeviceManagement classification parameter file.

.PARAMETER PrivilegedObjectClassificationSource
    Source of privileged objects to identify the scope of privileged objects and update the classification definition file for Microsoft Entra ID.
    Possible values are "All", "EntraOps", "PrivilegedObjectIds", "PrivilegedRolesFromAzGraph" and "PrivilegedEdgesFromExposureManagement".

.PARAMETER ClassificationParameterScope
    Array of RBAC systems whose classification files should be processed. Default is all supported RBAC systems.
    Possible values are "EntraID", "DeviceManagement", "Azure", "Defender", "IdentityGovernance" and "ResourceApps".
    EntraID, DeviceManagement, Azure and Defender are generated from their *.Param.json parameter files
    (placeholder substitution). EntraID resolves Administrative Unit (and directory-level fallback) scopes
    separately for privileged Users, Devices, Groups and Service Principals/Applications; WHY each resolved
    scope was added is persisted as ScopeReasoning_EntraID.json (ScopeCategory/ScopeId/ScopeName/Reason), same
    structure/intent as ScopeReasoning_DeviceManagement.json. Azure's <Tier0IncludedResourceScope>/<Tier1IncludedResourceScope> placeholders
    are resolved strictly by the hosted managed identity's own effective tier (ControlPlane-tier MI host ->
    Tier0, ManagementPlane-tier MI host -> Tier1). Defender supports only <Tier0IncludedResourceScope> and
    <Tier1IncludedResourceScope> placeholders, which are populated with the same Azure resource/subscription
    scope discovery, and only apply to RoleDefinitionActions that can genuinely be scoped in Defender Unified
    RBAC via Defender for Cloud (microsoft.xdr/securityposture/* actions). Defender for Identity (MDI) scope
    parameterization is not supported. IdentityGovernance is generated from
    Classification_IdentityGovernance.Param.json: every access package catalog and access package is classified
    by the most privileged resource assigned to it (groups by their EntraOps classification, directory roles by
    EntraID/default classification, API permissions from access package resource role scopes, Azure resources by
    the shared Tier0/Tier1 resource scope buckets). Scopes affirmatively classified as Tier1 (ManagementPlane) or
    Tier2 (UserAccess) are excluded from the ControlPlane wildcard via <Tier0ExcludedIdGovScope> and served by
    their own tier entries (<Tier1IncludedIdGovScope>/<Tier2IncludedIdGovScope>); everything else - including
    unclassifiable scopes and catalogs created between classification runs - stays Tier0 (conservative default).
    The per-scope reasoning is persisted as ScopeReasoning_IdentityGovernance.json (ScopeName/ScopeId/Source/
    EAMTier/ResultingScope/Reason). If the parameter file is missing, the previous template-only behavior applies
    (tenant-specific file only generated when role action overwrites exist). For
    ResourceApps, a tenant-specific classification file is only generated from the shipped template when API
    permission overwrites (Classification_ApiPermissionOverwrites.json) exist in the tenant-specific
    classification folder.
    Role action overwrites are considered and applied for EntraID, DeviceManagement, Defender, Azure and
    IdentityGovernance; API permission overwrites are considered and applied for ResourceApps; always AFTER any
    Tier0/Tier1 placeholder substitution for that RBAC system, and only for the generated tenant-specific
    classification files, never for the shipped templates.
    For Azure, an overwrite whose action already lives in a category whose scope is driven by the hosted
    managed identity's own tier (e.g. "Managed Identity", "Compute", "Storage") will remove that action from
    the dynamically-scoped entry and re-add it under the overwrite's own scope - a console warning is printed
    when this happens.
    Azure RBAC is always processed last to ensure managed identity EAM data from the other scopes is already available.

    The file must contain the <Tier0ExcludedIdGovScope>, <Tier1IncludedIdGovScope> and <Tier2IncludedIdGovScope>
    placeholders, which are populated with the catalog/access package scope IDs classified by
    Get-EntraOpsIdGovScopeClassification.

.PARAMETER IdGovCustomizedClassificationFile
    Path to the customized classification file for Identity Governance. Default is ./Classification/<TenantName>/Classification_IdentityGovernance.json.
    Generated from IdGovClassificationParameterFile with per-catalog/access package tier scopes substituted

.PARAMETER EntraOpsEamFolder
    Path to the folder where the EntraOps classification definition files are stored. Default is ./Classification.

.PARAMETER EntraOpsScopes
    Array of EntraOps scopes which should be considered for the analysis. Default selection are all available scopes: Azure, AzureBilling, EntraID, IdentityGovernance, DeviceManagement and ResourceApps.

.PARAMETER AzureHighPrivilegedRoles
    Array of high privileged roles in Azure RBAC which should be considered for the analysis. Default selection are high-privileged roles: Owner, Role Based Access Control Administrator and User Access Administrator.

.PARAMETER AzureHighPrivilegedScopes
    Scopes of high privileged Azure RBAC role assignments to consider for the Azure Resource Graph source.
    Each configured value is matched exactly against the assignment scope; child scopes are not included.
    Default selection is all scopes including management groups.

.PARAMETER ExposureCriticalityLevel
    Criticality level of assets in Exposure Management which should be considered for the analysis. Default selection is criticality level <1.

.PARAMETER PrivilegedObjectIds
    Manual list of privileged object IDs to identify the scope of privileged objects and update the classification definition file for Microsoft Entra ID.

.PARAMETER DeviceMgmtPrivilegedTierScope
    Controls which privileged tiers and object types are included when building Device Management (Intune) scope tag assignments.
    "ControlPlaneAndManagementPlane" (default): Tier0 (ControlPlane) and Tier1 (ManagementPlane) devices and users are both included.
    "ControlPlaneDevicesOnly": Only devices owned by Tier0 (ControlPlane) users are included; Tier1 and user group memberships are skipped.

.PARAMETER IncludeObjectDetails
    Include object display names, UPNs, classification reasons, and related descriptive metadata in console
    output. Defaults to ConsoleOutput.IncludeObjectDetails from EntraOpsConfig.json. Object IDs are always shown,
    and persisted classification reasoning files retain the full audit data.

.EXAMPLE
    Get privileged objects from various Microsoft Entra RBACs and Microsoft Azure roles to identify the scope of privileged objects and update the classification definition file for Microsoft Entra ID.
    Update-EntraOpsClassificationControlPlaneScope -PrivilegedObjectClassificationSource "EntraOps" -RBACSystems ("Azure","EntraID","IdentityGovernance","DeviceManagement","ResourceApps")

.EXAMPLE
    Get exposure graph edges from Microsoft Security Exposure Management with relation of "has permissions to", "can authenticate as", "has role on", "has credentials of" or "affecting" to assets with criticality level <1.
    This identitfies objects with direct/indirect permissions which leads in attack/access paths to high sensitive assets which can be identified as Control Plane.
    Update-EntraOpsClassificationControlPlaneScope -PrivilegedObjectClassificationSource "PrivilegedEdgesFromExposureManagement" -ExposureCriticalityLevel = "<1"

.EXAMPLE
    Get permanent role assignments in Azure RBAC from Azure Resource Graph for high privileged roles (Owner, Role Based Access Control Administrator or User Access Administrator) on specific high-privileged scope ("/", "/providers/microsoft.management/managementgroups/8693dc7e-63c1-47ab-a7ee-acfe488bf52a").
    Update-EntraOpsClassificationControlPlaneScope -PrivilegedObjectClassificationSource "PrivilegedRolesFromAzGraph" -AzureHighPrivilegedRoles ("Owner", "Role Based Access Control Administrator", "User Access Administrator") -AzureHighPrivilegedScopes ("/", "/providers/microsoft.management/managementgroups/8693dc7e-63c1-47ab-a7ee-acfe488bf52a")

.EXAMPLE
    Use previous named data sources to identify high-privileged or sensitive objects from EntraOps, Azure RBAC and Exposure Management to update EntraOps classification definition file.
    Update-EntraOpsClassificationControlPlaneScope -PrivilegedObjectClassificationSource "All"

.EXAMPLE
    Get list of privileged object IDs to identify the scope of privileged objects and update the classification definition file for Microsoft Entra ID.
    $PrivilegedUser = Get-AzAdUser -filter "startswith(DisplayName,'adm')"
    $PrivilegedGroups = Get-AzAdGroup -filter "startswith(DisplayName,'prg')"
    $PrivilegedObjects = $PrivilegedUser + $PrivilegedGroups
    Update-EntraOpsClassificationControlPlaneScope -PrivilegedObjectClassificationSource "PrivilegedObjectIds" -PrivilegedObjectIds $PrivilegedObjects

.EXAMPLE
    Update classification for Entra ID, DeviceManagement (Intune), and Azure RBAC. Azure runs last and uses Exposure Management (criticalityLevel < 1) and EntraOps EAM managed identity data to parameterize Tier0/Tier1 resource scopes.
    Update-EntraOpsClassificationControlPlaneScope -PrivilegedObjectClassificationSource "EntraOps" -ClassificationParameterScope ("EntraID", "DeviceManagement", "Azure")

.EXAMPLE
    Update classification only for Azure RBAC scope parameterization.
    Update-EntraOpsClassificationControlPlaneScope -PrivilegedObjectClassificationSource "EntraOps" -ClassificationParameterScope ("Azure")

.EXAMPLE
    Update classification for both Entra ID and DeviceManagement (Intune) RBAC systems. The DeviceManagement logic resolves privileged devices to scope tags.
    Update-EntraOpsClassificationControlPlaneScope -PrivilegedObjectClassificationSource "EntraOps" -ClassificationParameterScope ("EntraID", "DeviceManagement")

.EXAMPLE
    Update classification only for DeviceManagement (Intune) RBAC based on EntraOps data.
    Update-EntraOpsClassificationControlPlaneScope -PrivilegedObjectClassificationSource "EntraOps" -ClassificationParameterScope ("DeviceManagement")

.EXAMPLE
    Update DeviceManagement classification using only Tier0 (ControlPlane) owned devices - Tier1 and user group memberships are excluded.
    Update-EntraOpsClassificationControlPlaneScope -PrivilegedObjectClassificationSource "EntraOps" -ClassificationParameterScope ("DeviceManagement") -DeviceMgmtPrivilegedTierScope "ControlPlaneDevicesOnly"

.EXAMPLE
    Update Azure RBAC classification and see WHY each Azure resource scope (e.g. the resource hosting a
    user-assigned managed identity that itself became Tier0/ControlPlane via an Entra ID role, API permission
    or other privileged role assignment) was included in Tier0. The per-resource reason is written to the
    console/log AND persisted alongside Classification_Azure.json as
    ScopeReasoning_Azure.json (Tier0Scope, Tier1Scope and
    ScopeDetails with ScopeName/ScopeId/Source/EAMTier/ResultingScope/Reason per resource scope - structure
    aligned with ScopeReasoning_IdentityGovernance.json) for
    later auditing - it is not part of the PrivilegedEAM export itself. Interactively (or in the corresponding
    Pull-EntraOpsPrivilegedEAM / Update-EntraOps.yaml job log) you can also look for the "Azure RBAC
    Classification Summary" section near the end of the console output. It lists every resource grouped by
    Source (SystemAssignedMI, UserAssignedMI, UAMIConsumer or ExposureManagement) together with its EAM tier
    and Reason, for example:
      [UserAssignedMI] (1 resource(s))
        uami-deployment-agent [EAM: ControlPlane]
          Reason    : User-assigned MI resource: uami-deployment-agent (3f2c1a9e-...)
          ResourceId: /subscriptions/<subId>/resourcegroups/<rg>/providers/microsoft.managedidentity/userassignedidentities/uami-deployment-agent
      [UAMIConsumer] (1 resource(s))
        vm-web01 [EAM: ControlPlane]
          Reason    : Uses UAMI: uami-deployment-agent / MI: uami-deployment-agent
          ResourceId: /subscriptions/<subId>/resourcegroups/<rg>/providers/microsoft.compute/virtualmachines/vm-web01
